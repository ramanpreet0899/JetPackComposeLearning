    <string name="compose_learning_description">A fundamental difference between View-based UI and Jetpack Compose is that Compose doesn\'t rely on View to render its composables. As a consequence of this architecture approach, Android Studio offers extended features for Jetpack Compose without having to open an emulator or connect to a device. Compared to Android Views, this allows a faster, iterative process for developers to implement their UI designs.</string>
